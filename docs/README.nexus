[size=3][u][b]Features[/b][/u][/size]
[list]
[*] Always the closest possible target will be selected to attack.
[*] Several ships/fleets with one order can work in one sector or crossed sectors.

[size=3][u][b]Executing the order[/b][/u][/size]

You can select the order as any other, like "Protect Station" or "Protect Ship", from the "Combat" section of  orders.
Please be aware - this order requires the ship captain to have at least [b]two stars[/b] in the "Pilot" skill.

[size=3][u][b]Configuration[/b][/u][/size]

There are a several configuration options available. You can see all of them on a screenshot.

[size=3][u][i]Home Sector[/i][/u][/size]

This is a sector which will be protected. You can select it from the list of discovered sectors.
If you select not current sector, the ship will fly to the selected sector to some "safe" point before to start protecting it.

It can be any known sector, even if it is not yours.

[size=3][u][i]Attack Stations[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Disabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, hostile stations in the protected sector will be attacked by ship and his squad.
It uses the specific logic to attack stations - equal to "Coordinate Attack" from the context menu.
With only one exception - the syncpoint will not be created. So, all squad ships will form the similar order but will not wait for each other.

[size=3][u][i]Attack Ships[/i][/u][/size]

You can select exact ship types:
[list]
[*] XL
[*] L
[*] M - [b]enabled[/b] by default
[*] S - [b]enabled[/b] by default
[/list]
By default, the S and M ships are selected.

If it will find a hostile squad - it will not be attacked, if it contains at least one ship of the type higher than highest selected one.

[size=3][u][i]Attack farther from stations[/i][/u][/size]

There is a slider to define a minimal distance from the possible target to the hostile station. If the distance is less than the defined value, the ship will be selected as a target.
If value is 0 - the distance will not be checked.

Default value is [b]0[/b].

[size=3][u][i]Attack only visible targets[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Enabled[/b] by default.

Used to prevent the ship from attacking the target, which is not revealed yet or not visible for the player.

It has slightly different behavior for stations and ships:
[list]
[*] For stations - the station should be visible on a map. So - it has to be revealed, but it is not required to be in a live view, i.e. in radar range of your ships, stations, satellites, etc.
[*] For ships - the ship should be visible online. So - it has to be in a radar range of your ships, stations, satellites, etc.
[/list]
[size=3][u][i]Attack only hostile targets[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Enabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, the ship will attack only hostile targets. It will use the appropriate command to filter the targets.

[size=3][u][i]By negative relation[/i][/u][/size]

[size=3][u][i]Protect our ships and stations in sector[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Enabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, the ship will react on the event when the player's ships or stations are attacked in the sector. It will try to protect them by attacking the hostile ships.

[size=3][u][i]- except military ships[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Enabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, the ship will not protect the military ships. It will not attack the hostile ships, which are attacking the military ships.

[size=3][u][i]Pursue fleeing targets[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Disabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, the ship will pursue the target, which is trying to flee after is being attacked.

[size=3][u][i]Share target with other[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Enabled[/b] by default.

If you have more than one ship or squad with the same order, you can disable this option to prevent them from attacking the same target.

[size=3][u][i]Attack distance: percentage of radar range[/i][/u][/size]

This setting allows you to define the ship behavior when the target is identified and selected.
The attack de facto contains two stages:
[list]
[*] The ship is trying to reach the target till some acceptable distance. This distance is defined as a percentage of the radar range.
[*] The ship is trying to attack the target when it is in the acceptable distance.
[/list]
[size=3][u][i]Avoid boosters usage[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Disabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, the ship will not use the boosters to increase the speed. In game version prior [b]7.50[/b] it will help to preserve the shield energy. For version [b]7.50[/b] and higher, boosters are used always, despite the [b]Avoid boosters usage[/b] option.

[size=3][u][i]Disable on destruction threat[/i][/u][/size]

It is a percentage of hull of the target to make this order disabled. Useful when you want to achieve more abandoned ships.

By default, it is [b]0 percent[/b] - i.e. disabled this check.

If set to non-zero value, the ship will stop attacking when hull is less than desired percent.

[size=3][u][i]Park at sector core[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Disabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, the ship will try to park at the sector core, when it is not targets to fight against.

[size=3][u][i]Park exactly there[/i][/u][/size]

[size=3][u][i]Delay between scans, seconds[/i][/u][/size]

Default value is [b]4 seconds[/b].
If you want - you can set it in between 1 and 90 seconds, with step 4 seconds. Bigger value will make less load on the CPU...

[size=3][u][i]Record to logbook[/i][/u][/size]

[b]Enabled[/b] by default.

If enabled, the ship will record the events to the logbook. I.e. starts, travel to desired sector, flying to the target, attacking the target, destroying the target, etc.

[size=3][u][b]Situation when nothing to attack[/b][/u][/size]

If no Attack target is selected (i.e. no station and no any ship types are selected) - the ship's captain will periodically call to the player to inform about absence of the order.
